/* ===============================
   STEP 1 — Base List Item Styling
   =============================== */

/*
  1. Select ALL <li> elements that are inside the list
     with class "items".
  2. Add padding inside each list item.
  3. This spacing should make the text easier to read
     and increase the interactive area.
*/

/* ===============================
   STEP 2 — Hover Interaction (:hover)
   =============================== */

/*
  1. Use the :hover pseudo-class on the list items.
  2. Change the background color ONLY while
     the user’s mouse is over the item.
  3. This visually shows that the item is interactive.
*/

/* ===============================
   STEP 3 — Focus Interaction (:focus)
   =============================== */

/*
  1. Use the :focus pseudo-class on the list items.
  2. This style should appear when the item is
     selected using the keyboard (Tab key).
  3. Apply a visible outline so users know
     which item is currently focused.
  4. NOTE: <li> elements must be focusable in HTML
     using tabindex="0".
*/

/* ===============================
   STEP 4 — First Item Styling (:first-child)
   =============================== */

/*
  1. Use a pseudo-class to target ONLY the FIRST
     list item inside the list.
  2. Make this item visually stronger than the others.
  3. This is commonly used to highlight priority items.
*/

/* ===============================
   STEP 5 — Last Item Styling (:last-child)
   =============================== */

/*
  1. Use a pseudo-class to target ONLY the LAST
     list item inside the list.
  2. Change the text color to make it appear softer
     or less emphasized.
  3. This helps create visual hierarchy.
*/

/* ===============================
   STEP 6 — Targeting by Position (:nth-child)
   =============================== */

/*
  1. Use a pseudo-class that allows selecting
     an element by its position in the list.
  2. Target the SECOND list item.
  3. Apply a subtle background color.
  4. Remember: counting starts at 1, not 0.
*/

/* ===============================
   STEP 7 — Adding Content Before (::before)
   =============================== */

/*
  1. Use a pseudo-element to insert content
     BEFORE the text of each list item.
  2. The inserted content should be a symbol
     or character.
  3. This content does NOT exist in the HTML.
  4. Set a color for the inserted content.
*/

/* ===============================
   STEP 8 — Adding Content After (::after)
   =============================== */

/*
  1. Use a pseudo-element to insert content
     AFTER the text of each list item.
  2. The inserted content should be visually subtle.
  3. This is often used for icons or indicators.
*/

/* ===============================
   STEP 9 — Styling the First Letter (::first-letter)
   =============================== */

/*
  1. Use a pseudo-element to target ONLY
     the first letter of each list item.
  2. Increase the size of the first letter slightly.
  3. This creates a typographic emphasis effect.
*/

/* ===============================
   STEP 10 — Styling the First Line (::first-line)
   =============================== */

/*
  1. Use a pseudo-element to target ONLY
     the first line of text inside each list item.
  2. Make the first line visually stronger.
  3. The first line depends on screen size
     and container width.
*/

/*
  ✅ After completing all steps:
  - Save the file
  - Refresh the browser
  - Test hover with mouse
  - Test focus with Tab key
  - Resize the browser to observe ::first-line behavior
